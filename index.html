			<h1>Klimt</h1>
			<p>This OneHourProject accepts an image input and returns a hexadecimal color scheme that will nicely match the image. It also returns the text of a <code>*.tmTheme</code> file, which is used for TextMate and Sublime color schemes. This means that you can use Klimt to generate syntax highlighting that matches a famous piece of art. It is so named because of the consistent but diverse color palette of the eponymous symbolist artist, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt">Gustav Klimt</a>.</p>
			<p>You can plug the resultant color scheme into a TextMate theme template for <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. (This is the result of a second OneHourProject that took the initial color-finding algorithm and applied it to the theme). This code does not do contrast-checking, so you may wind up with an unusable color scheme (at least until the next iteration)!</p>
			<p>The color scheme for this text was taken from a Klimt portrait of Adele Bloch. The fuchsia background was taken from an interesting picture of a matchbox I found on the internet somewhere.</p>

			<p>Below is a demo of a color scheme generated using this software.</p>
			<img style="width: 50%; margin: 0 25%" src="demo.jpg">

			<h2>The Dealio</h2>
			<p>I use <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a> to find the 'primary color' of the image, using an algorithm something like this:
<pre>
for every pixel in the image:
	for every hue in 0..359:
		add +1 to the association of that hue.

find the saturation of the most common hue by finding the
average saturation of all of the pixels with that hue value,
or within a certain range on either side.

------------------------------------------------------------

Next, pick a pixel at random. If a similar hue has not been
found yet, add this to the list of interesting colors.
Otherwise, pick a different pixel.
</pre>
			</p>
			<p>There are clearly better ways of finding interesting or important colors, but my hour was running low and my other method was returning things that were <i>too</i> unique; this effect could be mitigated by averaging a few pixels when sampling the image.</p>

			<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
			<p>If the software has a hard time finding a prevailing hue, or if the hue is (practically) white, it may return a bright red color. This means that your image choice was poor. Shame on you.</p>
			<p>Noisy images (with pixelation artifacts) may give strange results. (This too could be mitigated by averaging more points).</p>
